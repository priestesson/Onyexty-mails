Hi Vincent,
We are sincerely sorry for the inconvenience you experienced on Your last access Your Account was Mistooken for another investor that has embezzled $100,000 from the company system. While accidents do happen, it’s our job to own them by responding quickly and doing everything in our power to restore the trust we’ve lost in the process.
We spent some time investigating the cause of miss identification. In full transparency, here’s exactly what happened:
1. Your Email was Registered on the stakeholders board(Mis-identification) 
2. An Activity that we presume must not have come from you hit our system from your part of the country 
Our hope is to never inconvenience you, which is why we plan to improve our target of bringing you here to the board for a meeting and these past few months the US Supreme Court of Dallas has dismissed those who manipulated this act with Four Months sentence in federal prison to ensure something like this never happens again. 
If there are any questions you still have about the incident, please do not hesitate to reach out. We’d be happy to talk through them with you. 
Thank you,
Antpoolfrx
