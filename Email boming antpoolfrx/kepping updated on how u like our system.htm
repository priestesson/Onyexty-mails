 If you would like to start answering chats on your mobile device, download the https://www.tawk.to/features/iphone-app/ or the https://www.tawk.to/features/android-app/, they are both completely free. 
If you would prefer to use our desktop software to access the dashboard we have apps for Windows and Mac:

 How to Add additional agents to your site or page 
 To add a new agent: Go to Admin at the top of the https://tawk.to dashboard. Then find the site you want to add an agent to in the list of sites under properties. (If you only have 1 site it will be there by default). 
 Next go to Property Members then click Add.

 Remove the "Powered by tawk.to" link from widgets, and add your own Branding. 
 You can truly make the widget your own by removing the "Powered by tawk.to" link on the bottom of widgets and support ticket emails. 
 Find the instructions on how to https://www.tawk.to/updates/new-feature-remove-branding-white-label/. 
 Please Note: The white-label / Rebanding feature is a paid add-on and is completely optional, the app is still 100% Free with no limitations if you're happy to keep the "Powered by tawk.to" link on the bottom of widgets and support emails.
