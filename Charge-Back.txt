A chargeback is a reversal of funds which is initiated by the cardholder with their banking institution. As soon as (mt) Media Temple receives a chargeback notification, the account in question is suspended and a $25.00 fee will be added to the account. The account owner will receive notification of a chargeback via support request and services will not resume until (mt) Media Temple receives the required documentation.
