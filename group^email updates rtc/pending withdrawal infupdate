Hello Mr Sktelang1,

Thanks for reaching out! Do not be sad your messages to the support where forwarded to our mail by the system a Bug was found during a trade we had to make sure our investors security is keep 100% and all funds are safe we had to take Hours to Update our security and keep millions of funds at top trade and guarantee, this is the reason for late replies, I am more than happy that we have a reasonable investors that joined us successfully and made more topup trade.

Sadly Your withdrawal has been pending for days, can you give me a little more context on the situation? When did this issue begin happening? Have you ever reinvested your profit and capital at the same time? Has it been occurring consistently, or does it happen on and off? Have you tried any solutions on your own?

These questions will help me find a more personalized solution to your problem.

Thanks,
Admin R.t.c
